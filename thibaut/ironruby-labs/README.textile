h1. Labs with IronRuby and Mono on Mac OS X

h2. Prerequisites

* you'll need Ruby (not IronRuby) as a starter, as I'm using a Rakefile to script these things.
* install a recent build of Mono "http://mono.ximian.com/monobuild/preview/download-preview/":http://mono.ximian.com/monobuild/preview/download-preview/

h2. Checking the installation

Run the following command:

  bash-3.2$ rake happy
  (in /Users/thbar/Work/git/ironruby-labs)
  Checking mono >= 2.2 installed - OK (2.4)

h2. Download latest IronRuby bits

  rake download

Everything should be downloaded and unpacked under the Release folder.

h2. Revert to a previously downloaded version of the IronRuby bits

In case you meet some kind of regression, you can revert to a previously downloaded file with:

  rake revert version=10606

(Look for files named DLR.xxxxx.release.zip on your disk)

h2. Running an IronRuby file

  rake run ui/test_form_with_button.rb

(should run a simple form with a button)

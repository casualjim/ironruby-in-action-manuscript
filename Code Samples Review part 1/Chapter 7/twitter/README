==Project Description
For the IronRuby In Action book I wrote a limited implementation of Twitter.
This might be useful for other people so I decided to put it up here on Codeplex.
It should have the same urls for API calls as twitter does except for the domain of course ;)
It is written in Rails


It is by no means finished at this point and only implements the API I needed but it's pretty easy to add new stuff.

The idea is that it should run on IronRuby but at this moment it doesn't yet. So you need to get
Ruby 1.8.6 or 1.8.7 (MRI): http://www.ruby-lang.org/en/downloads/

And as gems you need:

    * Rails 2.2.2 gem

(sudo) gem install rails

    * RSpec gem

(sudo) gem install rspec

    * RSpec-Rails gem

(sudo) gem install rspec-rails

    * Sqlite3-ruby gem

(sudo) gem install sqlite3-ruby

To run the project you need to migrate and populate the database first.
To do this navigate into the twitter folder of the repository and execute the following commands:

rake db:migrate
rake db:fixtures:load
script/server

You can specify your own data that is to be loaded in the database by editing twitter/db/fixtures/*.yml

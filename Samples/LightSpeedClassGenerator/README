== LightSpeedClassGenerator

This gem generates models for the Mindscape LightSpeed ORM
It adds the generated files to the visual studio project file.
Currently it only supports Sql Server 2005

To use it you have to tell it which database it has to find by putting a database.yml file in your visual studio project directory.
The content of that database.yml file may look as follows

# on windows you can use the following connection string
#
# sqlserver:
#   database: northwind
#   host: localhost
#   username: sa
#   password: Password123

# on OSX and Linux you can connect to sql server through odbc (iODBC or unixODBC in combination with FreeTDS)
#
# sqlserver:
#   dsn: NorthwindSql
#   username: sa
#   password: Password123

To use the generator open a command shell and type generate_ls_models 

Optionally you can specify a different namespace and folder for the model files to be saved to:
generate_ls_models <<path to project file>> <<namespace>> <<path to save the models to>>
